This is a very simple node js file server app.

The app is in its basic version and I will adding more remaining features whenever I can manage time

To use the app
-Download the folder   
-Run 'npm install'  
-Run 'npm start'  
-Visit 'http://localhost:4000/'  


Place the file you want to serve in the 'public' folder.  
Enter the url/filename to access the file  
The file is publicly available and anyone access to the site can access the file.
